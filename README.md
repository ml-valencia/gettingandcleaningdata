# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is a peer-graded assignment repository for the Getting and cleaning Data Course Project. 

## Project Description 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The following are the requirements for submission:
1. Tidy Data set `tidydata.txt`
2. Link to a Github repository with script for performing analysis
3. Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed: `Codebook.md`

## Repository Inclusions
This repository contains the following files:
1. `tidydata.txt` contains the final tidy data set.
2. `run_analysis.R` contains the script for processing the raw data to the tidy data set. 
3. `README.md` 
4. `Codebook.md` contains discussion on the data and variables used.

## Final Notes
It must be noted that the code asssumes that the code will only work if the Samsung data was already unzipped in the working directory.
The script also requires the `reshape2` package.
